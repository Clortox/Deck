This has been my first attempt at making my own mobile deck, mostly as a prepper type tool, as well as acting as a linux laptop that is both rugged and cheap

## Contents
1. Stl files
  ..* All the files needed to 3d print to work with the exact components i used
2. Ipt files
  ..* The files that can be opened in Inventor, I used Inventor Pro 2019 to create all files, except for the display bracket, credit for that goes to jdoscher, find his build [here](https://github.com/jdoscher/Back7co-Raspberry_Pi_Recovery_Kit)
3. Code
  ..* Theres not much to talk about here, just some basic setup stuff and useful utilities, like the clock, and a tool to adjust the display brightness (NOT ADDED YET)
4. Media
  ..* Videos of the 3d prints, as well as pictures to help you build everything
